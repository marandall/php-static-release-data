The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of [PHP 5.1.1](/downloads.php).

This is a regression correction release aimed at addressing several issues that may cause issues for certain applications. The main fixes found in this release include the following:

- Native date class is withdrawn to prevent namespace conflict with PEAR's date package.
- Fixed fatal parse error when the last line of the script is a PHP comment.
- eval() hangs when the code being evaluated ends with a comment.
- Usage of \{$var} in PHP 5.1.0 resulted in the output of {$var} instead of the $var variable's value enclosed in {}.
- Fixed inconsistency in the format of PHP_AUTH_DIGEST between Apache 1 and 2 sapis.
- Improved safe_mode/open_basedir checks inside the cURL extension.
