    <announcement lang="en">Due to a few bugs in PHP 4.1.0, we decided to release PHP 4.1.1. The bugs that were fixed are not major ones but minor ones, which could be annoying if you get bitten by them.

 Our recommendation is that people who already upgraded to PHP 4.1.0 do **not** upgrade to [PHP 4.1.1](/downloads.php), unless they're experiencing one of the described bugs.

 **No** new features or security updates are available in this release.

Full list of fixes:

- Fixed incompatibility with Windows .NET / IIS 6 - may improve stability under other versions of IIS. (Zeev)
- Fixed bug that caused crashes or error notices on shutdown on threaded platforms. (Zeev)
- Fixed several crash bugs in the xslt extension. (Markus, Derick)
- Fixed problem with dbase not returning very large (larger than long) integers properly. (Vlad)

- Fixed several crash bugs in the mcrypt extension. (Derick)
